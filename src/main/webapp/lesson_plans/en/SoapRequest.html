</div>
<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
Web Services communicate through the use of SOAP requests. These requests are submitted to a web service in an attempt to execute a function defined in the web service definition language (WSDL). Let's learn something about WSDL files. Check out WebGoat's web service description language (WSDL) file. 
<p><b>General Goal(s):</b> </p>
Try connecting to the WSDL with a browser or Web Service tool. The URL for the web service is: http://localhost/WebGoat/services/SoapRequest The WSDL can usually be viewed by adding a ?WSDL on the end of the web service request. You must access 2 of the operations to pass this lesson.
