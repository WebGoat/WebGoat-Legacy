<b>How HTTP works:</b>
</p>
All HTTP transactions follow the same general format. Each client request and server response has three parts: the request or response line, a header section and the entity body. The client initiates a transaction as follows: <br>
<br>
 The client contacts the server and sends a document request <br>
</div>
  <br>
<ul>GET /index.html?param=value HTTP/1.0</ul>
 Next, the client sends optional header information to inform the server of its configuration and the document formats it will accept.<br>
 <br>
<ul>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.06 Accept: image/gif,image/jpeg, */*</ul>
After sending the request and headers, the client may send additional data. This data is mostly used by CGI programs using the POST method.<br>
